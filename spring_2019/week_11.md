## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I cleaned out our teams repo and merged changes which were not merging nicely due to various branch conflicts. I made a bit more documentation on the repository's layout, and what content the various folders had in them. I also uploaded our teams internal documentation, including the powerpoint just to have everything together in one location. I wanted to use this final status update to talk about what I have done over the semester, and what I have learned. 

What I did:
	I was tasked with working on the backend for the website. I decided to go with Django and SQLite, and decided upon a public framework which I made changes to so as to fit our teams need. Users are able to register on the website, and are able to browse and view the various pages and content held on these pages. I also worked on the documentation of our project, as I was the most experienced with the documentation process due to various internships and taking SD&D. I documented the code structure, repository structure, and made the powerpoint for my team to present our results to the rest of the class and professors. I managed our repository, there weren't mant challenges with this but there were a few conflicts which needed to be resolved. I also helped our front-end team with their workload, as the front-end team ended up downsizing from 3 to a single person. I formatted pages on our website to fit the various mockups that were provided to us by our leader. I also tried to be the medium which kept both other members of this team up to date on what needed to be done and what our current progress was. 

What I learned:
	I had previous experience working with Django as I was a part of RPI's careerfair web admin team, but it was nice to refresh myself on the functionality and convinience that Django provides. There aren't vary many front-end classes at RPI, so it was nice to finally learn a bit of BootStrap and work with JavaScript again. There was also a lot of volatility at the beginning with our team size, so dealing with that and taking on more work provided me with more experience on managing my time, and learning to take on more resonsibility when it is needed. With the documentation and presentation, I learned more on the management side of Software Development. It's always good to work on your soft skills. 

## This Week's Plan
