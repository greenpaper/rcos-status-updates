## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I was tasked with gathering some users to test the current version of our website and see where we could make improvements.  I found some friends who had free time and asked them to test the functionality of the website and took notes on the feedback given. There wasn't too much on the negative end, as the main parsing/calendar feature is still being worked on, so we only really tested the visual appeal and overall layout of the website. A few buttons were moved around, and some wording on the website was changed, which involved minimal changes to the HTML. 

## This Week's Plan

I plan to work on the presentation for my team, as it seems I am the one with the most free time. I also started to look at parsing algorithms we could use, but most of them involve knowledge of NLP, which I am only briefly familiat with. I also wanted to incorporate a few other changes to the front end based on user reviews. 

## Anything Blocking?

Our team has recently gotten very busy with other classes, so we have been stagnant in terms of additions to the site. 

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
