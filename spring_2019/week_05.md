## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over these last two weeks (including the work done over spring break) I added a few new pages to the website, and I have helped resolve some issues on GitHub which revolved around merge issues. I have a lot of experience with version control in the workplace so it was nice having that experience to fall back on. I also made a few changes to the frontend of the website as the backend work is mostly on hold for now. I moved a few buttoms/forms around and I updated some of the images on the website. 

## This Week's Plan

This week I will be focusing on making more changes to the frontend and helping the frontend team intergrate their changes onto the skeleton website I have given them. Most of the issues will likely revolve around the different versions of various technologies we all have, and how much of a pain it is to align these. 

## Anything Blocking?

Our group has lost a lot of members which was hard as we had given them work but now it needs to fall back on the members still around. 

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
