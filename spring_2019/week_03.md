## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over this last week I was messing around with SQLite, and I added a few more pages to our website. I am also
working on adding a few error pages for when unexpected behavior comes up. I also am working on a few 
quality of life issues, such as moving buttons around and testing the new placement on individuals. 

## This Week's Plan

This week I will continue testing the functionality of the website with real users. I will also get a database  setup to store user information. 

## Anything Blocking?

As I am working on the backend, I am waiting on the frontend team to give me their work so I can put it and test it 
into the pages and setup I currently have. 

## Notes

Finally got access to our teams git :)
