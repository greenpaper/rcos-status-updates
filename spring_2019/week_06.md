## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I helped work on a few changes to the front end. The homepage is now mostly set up in the github, and we will be moving on to completing the other pages. I am also working on implementing a form on the homepage for users to register and save profiles onto our database. The database was setup using sqlite as it is more lightweight to workwith that Postgres or Mongo, but I can always change up the database rather easily if we need to scale. 

## This Week's Plan

This week I will be working on the frontend/backend to complete the form to get users to register. This will involve testing the database, and making appropriate changes to the frontends template. 

## Anything Blocking?

Classes starting to pickup, losing time I had free before to work on rcos as much as I wanted. 

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
