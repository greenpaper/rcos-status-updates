## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I worked on adding some changes to our presentation, and made the presentation itself as my team was busy with other work. I also started writing some documentation for our project, in case a team wants to take up our work in the future. My next update will contain some similar info as I wanted to tie everything together in terms of our work and documentation. I also cleaned our git repository out a bit but need another week to finish all of this up. 

## This Week's Plan

I plan to work on writing a bit more documentation for our work and cleaning out our git repository. I am still waiting on a few members to also push their work to the repo so I can safely merge their work and make sure it all works together. I wanted to write a final status update this next week summarizing all the work I did. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing really, we presented and did our slight demo.

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
