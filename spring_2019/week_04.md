## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over this last week I got the registration access for users to work on the local running website on my machine. I have not tested the database on a server other users can access. I have also made a few small front-end changes which I will be running by our team leader, to see if the changes are what was requested for informally. I have also implemented two versions with PostgreSQL and SQLite as the database, and I have decided to continue pursuing the SQLite version, as it has better performance. I have also done some research on intergrating different front-end technology such as flask, and NodeJS into my current working skeleton website. 

## This Week's Plan

This week will be the beginning of Spring break, so I won't lie, I likely won't have stable internet to browse the internet for any issues I run into. I will be in Puerto Rico, and my AirBnb hasn't answered whether I will have access to fast internet. I will try to make some small front-end changes, as I can see those changes on my locally running version and these changes should be simple enough for me to not have to look too many things up. 
## Anything Blocking?

I am still waiting on the front-end teams changes. Our team has also scaled down in size so the lead's of the different sections being front, back, and PDF parsing are now the only members on the team. 

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
