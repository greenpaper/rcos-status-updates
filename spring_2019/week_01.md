## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over this last week, our team decided on the roles for each member. I am part of the backend team, with a focus on the
architecture of the website which will primarily deal with django. I was already familiar with django, but I had a quick refresher
and went through a small tutorial online to remember the specifics to django. I also went looking online and found a template 
which I feel will be good for the projects skeleton. I went about and did a bit of research to get a local version of the template running on my machine. The templates new on github is edge, and it's a django/bootstrap ready template. I've also been talking
to the frontend team and letting them know what some restrictions with this template is, and a timeline of when specific pages/
functionality will be ready on my end of the website. 

## This Week's Plan

Over this next week I would like to edit the template to make it specific to our project, add a few more pages to the template, and
possibly get a SQL database running to store user information. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing major at the moment, just getting used to working with django again. I havent used bootstrap before so I'm also not much help
when the frontend team asks me questions, so I should probably look into learning a bit of that. 

## Notes

Need access to our teams repo on github, just a note for myself to remember to ask our team lead for access.
