## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I implemented a feature on the homepage for users to register accounts for my team's service. Involved adding features to the bootstrap front end and meeting the requirements set by our team leader. He created some mock ups of what he envisioned the website would look like, so we are trying to follow that as close as possible. I tested the feature with a few accounts, and on different machines/browsers. Had some issues on IE but I think I know how to fix those. 

## This Week's Plan

I will continue testing this user registration feature and get some other individuals to test this feature to see if there are any quality of life issues. I will also continue working on the other pages, and get them to follow the guidelines set up in our previously made mockups. 

## Anything Blocking?

Some issues with the versioning of our technology. I forget Django2/3 have a lot of differences. 

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
