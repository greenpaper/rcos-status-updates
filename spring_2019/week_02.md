## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over this last week, I worked with the Django template that we are using as the website's skeleton. I studied the layout of the code, to make sure that
the various action of the website, such as user registration, are all mostly functional. I also added additional pages to the website, which my 
group will later modify with the help of the Front-End team. I added information for our team into our About page, and learned a little html. 

## This Week's Plan

Over this next week I would like to get our team's repo set up, and focus on getting a database set up to save user information. Perhaps setting up
is a little of a lofty goal, perhaps finding different databases to use, and then choosing one to work with would be better wording. Refresh myself
with PostgreSQL, and with SQLite. 

## Anything Blocking?

My computer seems to not have sufficient memory to run everything smoothly, might have to switch to my home desktop for better performance. 

## Notes

Still need access to our team's git.
