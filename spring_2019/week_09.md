## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the past week, I implemented a few small changed to the HTML, and moved some of the boxes around to fit inline with the templates our leader gave us. I also finished the presentation, or at least the most current version of the presentation and should only have to make a few changes to it based on feedback we get on the dry run. 

## This Week's Plan

I plan to work on the presentation and implement whatever feedback we get into the presentation as our final presentation is on Friday. I want to write some documentation for the website as well, as we wanted to leave info if future teams want to work on this project. 

## Anything Blocking?

A lot of final projects coming up for our team. 

## Notes

Pushed a few updates to our teams github.
